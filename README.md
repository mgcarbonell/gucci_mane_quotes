# Inspirational Gucci Mane Quotes for your Terminal

## Installation
1. Clone this repo to your local host.
2. Enter into your bash profile or your zsh profile with your preferred editor and create an alias (on my machine the alias is 'gucci') that will execute `python <file path/gucci_quotes.py>` (you might have to prepend with python3 depending)  
3. Run your command and enjoy an inspirational Gucci Mane quote.

## Inspiration
The inspiration from this project comes from https://opensauced.pizza/ and @bdougie. When I saw that he had one of my favorite Gucci Mane quotes on his page, I decided to make a Gucci Mane CLI quote generator.

## Thank Yous
Thank you to bdougie for the initial spark, and thank you to Gucci Mane for the inspirational quotes.
